# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the XML-Lib governance platform.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help teams:

- Document the reasoning behind key technical decisions
- Provide context for future team members
- Track the evolution of the architecture over time
- Enable informed discussion about changes

## Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

```markdown
# [ADR Number]: [Title]

**Status:** [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Context

What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision

What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
```
